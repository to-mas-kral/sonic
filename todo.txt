introduce shading space

thresholded alpha
stratified sampling for camera at least

denoising - probably OIDN, ADD AOV before...
swap tinyexr for OpenEXR
could use fast float by Emire...

could optimize images - track which channels are used...
image channel assignment (alpha for 2-3 channel images??)

overlapping triangles - tracing in camera-world space
infinite depth due to specular materials
