TOD0:

fix nonlinear multithreaded scaling
fix coateddiffuse multiwavelength

thresholded alpha
swap tinyexr for OpenEXR

COULD BE AN ISSUE:

image channel assignment (alpha for 2-3 channel images??)
overlapping triangles - tracing in camera-world space
infinite depth due to specular materials

IDEAS:

denoising - probably OIDN, ADD AOV before...
stratified sampling for camera at least
light sampling with solid angle

could use fast float by Emire...
could optimize images - track which channels are used...
